# Design Patterns Studies

## Creational Designer Patterns

As the [Classification of patterns from Refactoring Guru states](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/classification) 
**creational** patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

:bulb: - for all the patterns that will be presented below give a special attention to the **Applicability** section.

They are:
- [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method):
  - in the package `com.rochards.creational.factorymethod` there is a similar but slightly different approach to implement a factory method from [Factory Pattern in Java: Creating Objects with Ease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTfa97vXCAo) video.
- [Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory):
  - in the package `com.rochards.creational.abstractfactory` there is a slightly modified implementation example from [The Abstract Factory Pattern Explained and Implemented | Creational Design Patterns | Geekific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNpwWkdFvgQ) video.
- [Come back to Builder later](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder):
- [Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype):
  - this one is pretty straightforward and there is an implementation example following [this link](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype/java/example)
- [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton):
  - in the package `com.rochards.creational.singleton` there are some examples created from [this link](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton/java/example#lang-features)
