# Learning go

Projects that I've been using to practice Go:
- :file_folder: `01-hello` -> just a starting project;
- :file_folder: `02-todo-list-management` -> a simple to-do project that reads standard inputs from the user where you can **add**, **list**, **remove** and **mark as concluded** to-dos:
    - **add**: add a new to-do providing a description;
    - **list**: list all to-dos;
    - **complete**: mark a to-do as completed;
    - **delete**: delete a to-do.
- :file_folder: `03-personal-finance-tracker` -> a simple finance track project that reads standard inputs from the user where you can:
    - **add**: add a new transaction providing: *date*, *description*, *amount* and *type (income or expense)*;
    - **list**: list all transactions;
    - **update**: update a transaction;
    - **delete**: delete a transaction;
    - **summary**: show the total income and expenses and also the net balance.
