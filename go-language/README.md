# Learning go

Projects that I've been using to practice Go:
- :file_folder: `01-hello` -> just a starting project;
- :file_folder: `02-todo-list-management` -> a simple to-do project the reads standard inputs from the user where you can **add**, **list**, **remove** and **mark as concluded** to-dos.
- :file_folder: `03-personal-finance-tracker` -> *working in progress*
